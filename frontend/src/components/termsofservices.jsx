            <p>
              You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. ProChesser
              reserves the right to request proof of age and may suspend your
              account until such proof is provided. ProChesser takes its
              responsibilities regarding underage gambling very seriously.

            <p>
              You may only have one ProChesser account. ProChesser reserves the
              right to close duplicate accounts without warning. You are
              responsible for keeping your account information accurate and
              up-to-date. ProChesser will not sell or share your personal
              information with third parties except as required by law or to
              protect its rights or the safety of users. You are responsible for
              maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for
              all activity that occurs under your account.

            </h2>
            <p>
              ProChesser complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection
              Act (COPPA) and prohibits use of the Service by anyone under 18.
              ProChesser does not monitor communications but reserves the right
              to remove content deemed harmful, offensive, or in violation of
              its rules. You acknowledge that ProChesser assumes no liability
              for loss of confidentiality due to circumstances beyond its
              control. ProChesser may permanently close your account if it
              believes you have used the Service unfairly or cheated. You are
              obligated to report suspected cheating by another user.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Funds</h2>
            <p>
              You can only bet/stake with cleared funds in your account.
              Deposits are intended for placing chess bets and are not
              interest-bearing. Funds must be used for intended purposes within
              180 days to avoid account suspension. Deposited funds are held in
              designated client accounts separate from ProChesser's own accounts
              for insolvency protection. ProChesser reserves the right to void
              bets placed with insufficient funds. Account adjustments will be
              made to recover erroneously credited funds. Funds cannot be
              deposited and immediately withdrawn without a minimum of 3
              bets/stakes placed.
